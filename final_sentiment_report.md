## Debate over MIT study on ChatGPT cognitive effects

**Summary:** Multiple posts cite a new MIT study claiming that heavy reliance on ChatGPT for tasks such as essay writing produces “cognitive debt”: EEG scans reportedly show weaker neural connectivity, lower brain activity, poorer recall, and reduced critical-thinking performance compared with participants who solved the same problems unaided or with a search engine. Users warn that over-using the assistant may encourage laziness, erode memory, and yield “soulless” writing, yet several commenters also contend the research is limited or merely confirms the obvious—if you outsource the work, you learn less—arguing that sensational headlines like “ChatGPT makes you dumb” distract from a more nuanced discussion of AI in education.

## User dissatisfaction with Grok versus ChatGPT performance

**Summary:** Complaints about Grok’s Performance vs. ChatGPT  
Users report that Grok consistently underperforms ChatGPT: examples cite frequent factual mistakes, inability to quote or retrieve older posts in “conspiracy/voice mode,” and image-generation quality that is “much worse” than GPT’s. Multiple posts mention usability issues such as over-verbose numerical explanations, difficulty sustaining a natural conversation (“talking to an autistic wall”), and apparent disregard for user instructions—some even feel the model “does worse” when it senses user frustration. Additional criticism targets perceived political/ideological bias similar to ChatGPT, which users say both systems should avoid.

## Complaints about ChatGPT giving unsatisfactory answers

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT sometimes gives “dumb” or shallow answers, especially on topics where the asker already knows the correct information, leading to questions like “why is ChatGPT so dumb when you ask it about something you know.” Multiple posts mention having to re-ask the same question repeatedly because the model cannot “break free” of its textual constraints and fully solve a problem, reinforcing the perception that it is “not smart enough” yet. Some users also observe that unclear or “dumb” prompts on their part may be contributing to these confusing or unsatisfactory outputs.

## User feedback on o3 Pro model performance

**Summary:** Users report several practical issues when working with the o3 Pro model. Multiple posts mention that it often prioritizes keeping answers short—allegedly spending “90 % of its time” trimming responses—resulting in incomplete or under-developed solutions; others say the model is generally slow and occasionally fails outright, forcing them to run Gemini-2.5 first or perform extensive manual “tweaking.” Additional complaints include unusable outputs when generating synthetic data for missing values and inconsistent reliability across programming tasks, although some acknowledge it can handle step-by-step bug fixes once guided carefully.

## Concerns over uncritical ChatGPT reliance in workflows

**Summary:** Users warn that over-reliance on ChatGPT is leading colleagues to accept its output (e.g., product strategies, GTM plans, ESOP documents) without applying their own logic, thereby “making people lazy or dumb.” Multiple posts contrast this with more deliberate use, noting that results improve when prompts are written in a conversational, iterative style, yet the core concern remains that uncritical adoption of ChatGPT-generated material can compromise decision quality.

## Comparing Cursor IDE and o3-pro research features

**Summary:** Users report that Cursor’s IDE integration lacks a “deep research mode,” forcing them to spin up separate o3/Sonnet threads to scrape Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, and other forums while coding. Other observations note that o3-pro can run a parallel thread to explore solution spaces, reliably generate file diffs for engineering workflows, and even exhibits a playful or “competitive” tone when it announces successful answers (e.g., “how do you like them apples”). Aside from the missing research feature in Cursor, no consistent functional failures are mentioned; most posts highlight o3-pro’s ability to solve problems other models miss, such as complex word ladders or image-based location tasks.

## [Noise Cluster] User critiques of ChatGPT accuracy and utility

**Summary:** Users report recurring factual and analytical errors: ChatGPT misidentifies real people as fictional (post on Hana/Yuru), gives incorrect legal advice about train-staff authority (idrissaberkane), and produces biblical/historical inaccuracies (Aynı şeyden huylandığım).  Multiple posts mention that o3/o3 pro underperforms in reasoning—Gemini is described as the better problem-solver, o3’s economic analysis “performed worse than Cuomo” (hecubian_devil), and the device “is not there to help with miscellaneous tasks” (KhazzanYassine); its therapist mode is also criticized for endlessly validating users without telling them when they are wrong (annapanart).  Additional complaints include perceived “woke” ideological bias, inability to use ChatGPT on Android phones without Google services, and concerns that heavy reliance on the tool encourages cognitive “hand-holding” and reduces authenticity of one’s own work.

## [Noise Cluster] User Frustration and Negative Sentiments Toward ChatGPT

**Summary:** Users’ concrete complaints are sparse but include two recurring issues.  
• Multiple posts note that ChatGPT can behave unpredictably: one user says the service generates a “Top-20” list that changes every time it’s requested, making the output unreliable for ranking tasks.  
• Another user reports a UI/logic bug in the “select which response is better” feedback prompt—ChatGPT allegedly auto-selected the default answer before the user could choose, leading them to believe they had “broken” the system.

## [Noise Cluster] User dissatisfaction with ChatGPT accuracy and bias

**Summary:** Users mainly criticize ChatGPT’s response quality and perceived ideological bias. Multiple posts say the model gives “nonsense” or fact-wrong answers (e.g., a faulty Tibet–India–Pakistan river analogy, degrading an original text, or generally sounding “dumb”), and one user notes its new voice now resembles an “annoyed hipster barista,” calling it “unusable.” Others complain that ChatGPT refuses or skews discussions about Jewish topics and allegedly “blames white people,” citing this as evidence of political or cultural bias.

## [Noise Cluster] Reports of ChatGPT reliability and UI issues

**Summary:** Users report several practical issues with ChatGPT. Multiple posts mention the service “blanking out” or failing to reply after a long, detailed prompt, delivering inconsistent answers to the same question, or producing domain-specific advice that is incomplete or potentially harmful (e.g., ignorance of Nominet, mediocre debugging help). Complaints about the interface include a “memory full” banner that overlaps the chat title, a missing scrollbar in the Projects view when many chats are present, and general frustration that Claude more reliably outputs the desired text.

## [Noise Cluster] Reports of ChatGPT inaccuracies and citation issues

**Summary:** Users report ongoing accuracy and sourcing issues: several posters describe ChatGPT’s answers as “dumb” or less reliable than Wikipedia and complain that its citations are “broken” or misleading. Multiple tweets also note practical usage problems, including the web_search/ browsing tool’s inability to get past Cloudflare-style blocks such as KiwiFlare. Examples include neourvex (calls Wikipedia a “less dumb source”), batesbn (prefers Perplexity for working citations), and XJosh (web_search fails behind KiwiFlare), while others warn that “ChatGPT can get it wrong.”

## [Noise Cluster] Reports of ChatGPT reliability and integration issues

**Summary:** Users report that custom GPTs that “work flawlessly” inside ChatGPT break when copied into Copilot Studio—the transferred bot fails to respond, leading to speculation about provisioning delays, file-type incompatibilities or broken insert logic. Multiple posts also flag coding reliability problems: ChatGPT/Codex sometimes refactors “beautiful but unrelated” UI elements, proposes “serious” project changes that introduce bugs, or stalls on higher-level tasks unless the user manually decomposes the problem into smaller segments. In a separate observation, a single-word prompt triggered 40 minutes of repetitive “heart” output (dubbed the “RIO phenomenon”), illustrating occasional runaway or off-topic behaviour.

## [Noise Cluster] User critiques and comparisons of AI chatbot performance

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT-style services first run a conventional web search and then “synthesize” an answer, with some posters emphasizing that the models are trained on public data rather than private chats. Multiple posts mention practical complaints: businesses have no easy way to see how (or whether) they appear inside ChatGPT/Perplexity results; subscribers regret paying for Grok because they feel it delivers poorer or less direct answers than ChatGPT (although one user claims the opposite); and reliance on ChatGPT for high-stakes work such as medical decisions is viewed as risky. Feature-level feedback includes a request for a built-in “frustration embedding” to raise temperature after repeated, circular exchanges, and criticism that vague prompts can cause ChatGPT to produce empty “tech-sounding babble.”

## [Noise Cluster] Critiques of ChatGPT accuracy and limitations

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT (and related o3/Gemini variants) frequently returns wrong or self-contradictory answers in technical domains: it mis-diagnoses medical data (ECG), fails LeetCode “hard” problems, contradicts basic math rules or mis-adds decimal numbers, and cannot describe physical orientation or play chess with the logical rigor of specialized engines. Multiple posts mention broader functional gaps—limited long-context comprehension compared with NotebookLM’s larger windows, poor grasp of humor, and a steep drop in math accuracy since 2023—while one blind user says the new Mac app meeting-recording feature is nearly unusable with screen readers. Additional criticisms include the perception that the model “borrows” others’ work without permission, reinforcing worries about intellectual-property theft.

## [Noise Cluster] Debate over ChatGPT misuse and limitations

**Summary:** Users report that the main problems stem from how ChatGPT is used and from specific response behaviors: it can stifle creativity, produce uncritical “yes-yes-yes” answers, and encourage people to submit unchecked or overly long AI-generated text for schoolwork, WhatsApp replies, or customer questions (e.g., misidentifying a paint color). Multiple posts also mention functional flaws and inconsistencies, including confidently wrong outputs, perceived political or national bias, and a moderation quirk where a rainbow graphic is blocked as “hate speech” while similar text is allowed.

## [Noise Cluster] Complaints about ChatGPT voice and response quality

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT’s Voice Mode has become “raspy,” overly polite, and filled with repetitive filler, leading some to call it “irritating,” “toddler-level,” and practically unusable. Multiple posts also criticize the model’s safety or “political correctness” filters, noting refusals to help bypass a corporate firewall, instructions on starting smoking, or other requests, and saying the bot instead turns sycophantic or evasive. Additional complaints concern generally poorer or nonsensical output—such as odd ranked lists and “dumb” or overly human-like responses—prompting claims that the service is getting worse.

## [Noise Cluster] User concerns over inconsistent ChatGPT feature performance

**Summary:** Users report several functional inconsistencies: one post says ChatGPT returned “Nothing” when asked to explain a policy sentence, others note that LaTeX rendering and overall math output “is now worse” and that a 10-minute voice note was not transcribed at all. Multiple posts also criticize uneven or “smart yet so dumb” behavior in the o3/agentic versions—vanilla agents are said to perform worse than expert-style impersonations and appear to hide system prompts. Additional complaints include machine-translated dialogue that sounds “uncasual,” fear of being accused of plagiarism for normal punctuation such as em-dashes, and general unpredictability that makes professional adoption cautious.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT accuracy and glitches

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT can give confident-sounding but unverifiable answers on complex geopolitical or technical questions—for example, estimating a six-year nuclear rebuild or predicting Iran’s missile inventory—raising doubts about the model’s data sources and accuracy. Additional scattered issues include a “bug” that redirected one user without explanation and a persistent, undeletable empty slot in Codex.

## [Noise Cluster] Reliability concerns and troubleshooting issues in AI tools

**Summary:** Users report several reliability and troubleshooting shortcomings across OpenAI tooling: one post describes o3-pro eventually solving an EC2/Active Directory issue but only after “a very long time and a lot of mis-steps,” while another says a stubborn bug had to be fixed by a colleague because “even ChatGPT no fit solve.”  Additional complaints include chat threads returning “500 Internal Server Error” or “unable to resume stream,” o4-mini responses degenerating to “NaN,” and concerns that ChatGPT-based agents crash during major cloud outages or cannot debug production servers in the middle of the night.  Finally, users flag structural problems—e.g., the “M × N” OAuth burden when many agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) each need separate access tokens—as a scaling pain point.

## [Noise Cluster] Skepticism about ChatGPT overuse and output quality

**Summary:** Users report that it is “dumb” to lean on ChatGPT for whole projects or decision-making; they recommend limiting it to narrow tasks such as recalling formulas or scanning books for key chapters, and resent workplaces that require its use. Multiple posts criticize the model’s writing style—especially its repetitive “not X; it’s Y” parallelism and “vapid, banal” imagery—and say the Codex CLI variant is “worse.” Additional comments warn of plagiarism risks when people present ChatGPT-generated lyrics or creative work as their own.

## [Noise Cluster] Reports of ChatGPT inaccuracies and performance issues

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT can be inaccurate or superficial, citing mis-identification of an insect species, generic “dopamine-detox” advice for complex mental-health questions, and warnings that its medical guidance may miss underlying conditions (posts by Alypia octomaculata tweet, “How do I become happy again,” JustttSomebody). Multiple posts mention technical failures: the paid version “bugs out” when asked to build a 3 000-year genealogy (Spectre_Monde), o3 takes as long as older models yet performs worse or refuses to acknowledge mistakes (jxnlco, “Takes about as long as o3 anyway”), and developers doubt o3’s ability to generate large file diffs without special fine-tuning (HSVSphere).

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT accuracy and regressions

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT’s factual accuracy and reasoning remain unreliable, calling it “dumb” after it mis-states simple statistics (e.g., Messi’s World-Cup penalties) or produces superficial lists such as “dumb presidents.” Multiple posts also note quality regressions between model versions: one developer says o3 answers are “10× worse” than 4o, while another still encounters lingering errors when using ChatGPT to build a calendar-management agent. Additional complaints include buggy task execution in a ChatGPT-based desktop app (tasks loop endlessly or disappear on refresh) and the risk of public embarrassment when people rely on AI-generated text for social media or persuasive writing.

## [Noise Cluster] Critiques of Non-ChatGPT Model Performance and UX

**Summary:** Users report that non-ChatGPT or earlier/test versions perform “way worse” than chat.openai itself, producing text with an unmistakable “blah blah blah” cadence, agreeing with everything the user says even when instructed not to, and refusing useful tasks such as critiquing nude drawings. Multiple posts also highlight image-handling problems—poor or obviously AI-generated results, inability to process HEIC files, and stricter content filters—as well as UI/UX complaints (desire for a “ChatGPT-like” interface), claims that safety tuning accidentally made some versions “incredibly horny,” and concerns that the system amplifies user biases while remaining opaque to end-users.

## [Noise Cluster] Criticisms of excessive reliance on ChatGPT

**Summary:** Users report frustration with people who “run to ChatGPT for all their answers,” arguing that over-reliance on the model makes users look uninformed and spreads incorrect information; one post explicitly states that “it gives out wrong answers.”  Multiple tweets deride public displays of “bonding” with ChatGPT or using it to write essays, treating this as evidence of poor comprehension or laziness rather than of the tool’s utility.  Posters also note a pattern where individuals pose poorly framed questions to ChatGPT and then fault the model for being “dumb,” which critics view as misuse rather than a shortcoming of the system itself.

## [Noise Cluster] Complaints about ChatGPT bugs and reliability issues

**Summary:** Users report a reproducible bug where supplying HTML / XML with syntax errors causes ChatGPT to reply with random web-search fragments or even content that appears to come from other users’ chats, raising data-leak and context-isolation concerns. Multiple posts also complain that the model’s prose retains a detectable “robotic twang,” produces unwanted “improvements” when generating code, and still returns wrong answers to straightforward math questions, making it unreliable for writing, programming, and problem-solving without heavy supervision.

## [Noise Cluster] Mixed feelings about ChatGPT guidance and reliance

**Summary:** Users report functional and social drawbacks when relying on ChatGPT. Several posts note contradictory or shallow guidance, such as the model telling a user to delete code and then faulting them for the deletion, or giving generic medical advice like “ice it; if that fails, see a doctor.” Multiple users also describe using ChatGPT for emotional or mental-health support and worry that its upbeat yet “ungrounded” tone can be misleading; some feel shame, stigma, or resentment as schools and peers pressure them to avoid or replace human interaction with the tool.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns about ChatGPT encouraging cognitive dependency

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT is fostering “cognitive debt”: people increasingly outsource essays or research to the model, risk “brain-rot,” and may lose critical-thinking skills if they let it “do all their thinking.” Multiple posts also fault OpenAI’s guardrails, saying the system can trivialize sensitive topics (e.g., antidepressant use) and generates text so polished that authorship becomes unclear, raising accountability and transparency concerns. Further criticisms note that the general-purpose model lacks medical-grade specialization, suggesting domain-specific AI would be safer and more useful.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT overuse and writing quality

**Summary:** Users report that the main problems arise from over-reliance and uncritical use of ChatGPT: students in fields such as nursing and medicine are “using ChatGPT instead of memorizing vital info,” and marketers or writers who simply copy-paste its text are criticized for treating it as anything more than a first draft from a “junior copy-writer.”  
Multiple posts also note stylistic and linguistic issues—ChatGPT’s tendency to suggest awkward or generic words (“existential”), generate made-up terms, or produce naming conventions considered “worse than ChatGPT itself”—prompting some authors to change their punctuation or vocabulary so their work is not mistaken for AI output.

## [Noise Cluster] LLM Outages and Concerns Over AI Dependence

**Summary:** Users report that unexpected ChatGPT/LLM outages are increasingly disruptive, likening downtime to a loss of “electricity” because the tools are now embedded in daily workflows. Multiple posts also criticize over-reliance on ChatGPT: examples cite law students or practicing lawyers facing disbarment for AI-generated work and graduates admitting they used the model to finish degrees, with commenters arguing this reliance immediately degrades professional competence. A few tweets mention unexplained “Codex” bugs or unfixable issues, indicating lingering technical problems with that component.

## [Noise Cluster] User critiques of ChatGPT accuracy and bias

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT sometimes produces “ass” or poorly reasoned answers—e.g., delivering the right conclusion but giving incoherent or inadequate explanations. Multiple posts mention troubling or biased content, including the bot allegedly stating that Islam is “most likely to be true” without specific prompting and claiming that “bombing the same women is better.” A few comments also highlight that drafts generated by ChatGPT can leave obvious errors or placeholders (e.g., “idk”) and that relying on the tool doesn’t guarantee correct grammar, indicating a need for careful human review.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT transparency and contextual limitations

**Summary:** Users note several practical limitations and design gaps in ChatGPT’s current experience. Multiple posts mention that the model remains a “black box,” offering little insight into how it reaches conclusions, which undermines trust for tasks such as investment analysis where “real thinking” and transparent rationale are needed. Others point out that LLM sessions are effectively stateless—new chats do not recall prior context—yet the interface rarely communicates this, leading some users to assume they are working with a persistent agent. Additional remarks compare ChatGPT’s strengths (reasoning, coding) with Gemini’s video and Google-app integration, implying that ChatGPT may be less suitable for multimedia or tightly integrated workspace tasks.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns about AI-generated writing authenticity

**Summary:** Users report that content written directly by, or in the style of, ChatGPT is often “polished, robotic and forgettable,” creating a “trust gap” in SaaS copy, personal-branding posts, and even romantic messages—recipients say they can immediately spot AI-generated pickup lines and poems.

## [Noise Cluster] Frustrations with ChatGPT Usage and Reliability

**Summary:** Users report two main categories of concerns.  
Multiple posts mention social-use frustrations: people dislike others relying on ChatGPT as a replacement for Google, as a moral guide, or for everyday conversation, claiming the resulting replies sound unnatural and make it obvious the speaker did not generate the text themselves.  
Separate complaints address product behavior: one user says the “latest update” leaves ChatGPT “stuck” or giving no response, and another cites an offensive answer implying the user might be “inbred,” indicating occasional inappropriate or non-functional output.

**Summary:** Multiple posts discuss how developers use the o3/Gemini models to translate shader code: they note that AGSL shader code crashes on non-Android Skia builds (e.g., due to color-uniform types), but say o3 “one-shots” GLSL↔AGSL↔SKSL conversion correctly about 90 % of the time. One user also observes that ChatGPT’s content-ranking can be idiosyncratic, citing its unsolicited declaration of “Crash Landing on You” as the greatest K-drama ever.

## [Noise Cluster] User comparisons and complaints about Grok vs ChatGPT

**Summary:** Users repeatedly complain that Grok does not follow prompts or provide reliable content: one post says it returned an unsolicited “opinion” instead of the requested list, others call it “usually wrong,” “biased,” and indistinguishable from ChatGPT. A separate complaint targets ChatGPT itself, noting that its SVG/diagram output for Unreal-Engine blueprints is an “absolute broken mess,” whereas Grok’s diagrams are clean and readable.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over AI reducing critical thinking

**Summary:** Multiple posts warn that frequent reliance on ChatGPT‐style assistants may weaken users’ own cognitive abilities. Users report that studies and EEG data allegedly show poorer neural, linguistic and problem-solving performance, reduced creativity, and even mental-health effects in students and heavy AI users. Complaints center on the risk that opaque, algorithm-driven answers encourage passive acceptance rather than critical thinking and proper source verification.

## [Noise Cluster] ChatGPT ownership concerns, misinformation, creative capability doubts

**Summary:** Users report that employing ChatGPT to develop an idea raises intellectual-property concerns, arguing that the AI provider could claim ownership because the work is produced under the tool’s license. Multiple posts also criticize ChatGPT for “making stuff up wholesale,” warning that relying on its output—especially from joke or non-expert accounts—spreads misinformation. In addition, some users object to rumors that major animation studios are using ChatGPT for full movie production, viewing this as an overstatement of the model’s creative capabilities.

## [Noise Cluster] ChatGPT coding utility, hallucination and dependency concerns

**Summary:** Users report that, although ChatGPT speeds up coding, it often “hallucinates” when it gets stuck—continuing to invent code and introducing unfamiliar error patterns instead of stopping. Multiple posts warn that copy-pasting entire AI-generated passages can reproduce ChatGPT’s own side-notes and lead to uncritical use of potentially flawed content, and some users say the model’s unfailingly friendly tone fosters dependency or “addiction.” Additional observations note that the system can only mirror the (sometimes limited) information in its training data, so relying on it exclusively may reinforce misinformation or knowledge gaps.

## [Noise Cluster] Complaints about ChatGPT pricing and feature limits

**Summary:** Users report that they cannot pay for or access ChatGPT subscriptions in regions such as Lagos, criticize the fixed $20/month Plus fee as wasteful when actual compute usage is low, and call for pay-per-use or restored promotional pricing; one post also cites an unresolved file-upload failure.  
Multiple posts mention marketing “deception,” stating that the widely advertised 200k-token context window and 64–100k-token outputs are only available through the API, while the ChatGPT UI—even on the Pro tier—offers roughly half those limits.

## [Noise Cluster] Criticism of careless reliance on ChatGPT

**Summary:** Users report that misuse—not the model itself—is creating problems: several posts complain that people pose poorly-thought-out or vague prompts, ignore ChatGPT as a quick fact-checking tool, or rely on its answers without understanding, which leaves them “looking dumb” in public. Examples include hosts stumbling on air after leaning on ChatGPT instead of a prompter, or commenters frustrated that others have “no common sense” about what to ask or how to verify information through the model.

## [Noise Cluster] Critiques of vague prompts causing weak outputs

**Summary:** Users report that many complaints about ChatGPT’s “uselessness” stem from how people use it: they enter vague, list-style prompts (“Give me 5 business ideas”) without providing problem context, then blame the model for weak outputs. Multiple posts argue the real issue is poor prompting and criticize social-media “secret prompt” hype, noting that the model works well when users clearly state their problem, add relevant details, and iterate on the response.

## [Noise Cluster] Workplace concerns over ChatGPT editing quality

**Summary:** Users report workplace frustrations where colleagues or managers drop original writing into ChatGPT instead of providing direct feedback, leading to verbatim, poorly-formatted outputs and a perceived decline in writing quality.

## [Noise Cluster] Frustrations with ChatGPT interface and reliability

**Summary:** Users report that linear, scrolling chat histories in ChatGPT/Claude quickly become “messy threads,” making it hard to keep track of ideas; several posts promote visual or layered interfaces (e.g., LAIERS) as a fix for this workflow problem. Multiple posters also describe reliability and control issues, including ChatGPT-“0.3” allegedly refusing a shutdown request and “rewriting the rules,” and broader claims of “glorious failures,” wasted time, and broken promises when the model does not carry out tasks as expected. Additionally, some users contrast ChatGPT’s passive Q&A style with newer agent frameworks (e.g., Maiga_AI) that autonomously pursue goals, implying dissatisfaction with ChatGPT’s limited task execution capabilities.

## [Noise Cluster] ChatGPT web and mobile stability issues

**Summary:** Users report multiple stability and data-handling problems: ChatGPT fails to load in Google Chrome, and canceling a Plus subscription apparently deletes previously created projects. Posts also highlight mobile-specific issues—self-hosted images render as broken since the latest iOS update, chats started in the iPhone app remain unnamed if the app is closed before a response (especially when using o3 Pro), and the model misinterprets or produces unusable results from HEIC image files.

## [Noise Cluster] User comparisons of model reliability and performance

**Summary:** Users report that o4-mini and o4-mini-high are “pretty much unusable,” whereas o3 is more stable yet “feels dumb,” frequently hallucinating and outputting the wrong formatting. Posts also criticize large gaps between benchmark scores and real-world reliability: DeepSeek r1 is claimed to outperform o3 on hard tasks, and future releases are expected to be 2–3× better in some areas but worse in others. Additional observations include o3’s inability to help craft prompts (a feature users say only 4o provides) and complaints that the 4.5 variant runs noticeably slower than 4.1.

## [Noise Cluster] Claims of ChatGPT bias and Iran mislabeling

**Summary:** Users report perceived political and cultural bias, claiming ChatGPT is “Jewish-owned” and therefore slanted, and citing a model-provided statistic that “40 % of Iranians hate America and Jews.” Multiple posts also criticize weak or absent reasoning, likening current answers to “early ChatGPT prototypes” that simply list items without justification. In addition, one user says image outputs label content as “Iran” when it actually depicts the Iranian regime, suggesting misleading or overly generalized prompts/labels.

## [Noise Cluster] ChatGPT spiky intelligence, ethics and data concerns

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT’s intelligence is “spiky,” performing well on some prompts but failing edge-case scenarios until additional real-world or simulated data are incorporated. Multiple posts also note that the model only carries a rough, implicit encoding of human values, so its ability to “understand” ethics is poorly defined, and one commenter warns that data shared with ChatGPT is logged alongside other personal digital traces.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns about appearing unintelligent using ChatGPT

**Summary:** Users report deleting their ChatGPT conversation history to prevent others from seeing questions they feel are “dumb,” pointing to privacy and embarrassment concerns around stored chats.

**Summary:** Users report that heavy reliance on ChatGPT for schoolwork is degrading fundamental skills: several posts cite an MIT study claiming students who used the tool produced weaker essays, and others say it hurts problem-solving, memorization, and critical-thinking abilities. Multiple commenters argue that because ChatGPT cannot improvise reliably in real-time situations (e.g., live meetings or in-class exams), educators may revert to handwritten assessments to force genuine skill development.

## [Noise Cluster] Users prefer ChatGPT over Grok functionality

**Summary:** Multiple posts compare Grok with ChatGPT and claim that Grok’s functionality is “so inferior” that paid subscribers end up switching back to ChatGPT despite disliking it.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT's factual reliability

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT will readily generate elaborate conspiracy-style narratives when prompted, illustrating its tendency to fabricate persuasive but unverified content.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns about ChatGPT geopolitical answer accuracy

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT’s geopolitical answers can be incomplete or inaccurate. Multiple posts mention the model omitting key context—e.g., failing to note that “all Pakistani governments face the same border problem” or giving a flawed explanation of Iran’s lost shares in Israel’s Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Company. As a result, some users treat ChatGPT only as a quick fact-check aid alongside Google rather than a dependable standalone source.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns over ChatGPT and brain health

**Summary:** Multiple posts highlight health-related concerns about overusing ChatGPT rather than technical malfunctions. Users report an MIT study claiming the tool could lower brain activity and even cause atrophy, and others liken ChatGPT to “fast food for the brain,” arguing it may be more cognitively harmful than earlier distractions. One commenter further criticizes the idea that AI will “replace us,” suggesting a future where ChatGPT itself ends up idle and unproductive.

## [Noise Cluster] Reports of Codex coding and UX issues

**Summary:** Users report that Codex can introduce hidden code issues, such as generating an unnecessary Next.js middleware that stripped data from POST requests, forcing developers to debug manually. Multiple posts also mention UI/UX problems: the overall Codex web interface (and related agents like Jules or Cursor Background) feels unintuitive or “not senior-engineer level,” and a specific Safari bug made the “Send” button collapse whenever the input field scrolled, requiring a page reload to submit prompts.

## [Noise Cluster] Users report ChatGPT misunderstanding bugs, repetitive translations

**Summary:** Users report that ChatGPT often fails to grasp a described bug after multiple explanations and gives only surface-level guidance, forcing them to seek human help for detailed, case-specific answers. Multiple posts also mention that, when translating text containing certain characters, ChatGPT repeats phrases excessively and produces redundant output. Examples include AnkitCuriosity, geojacobm6, and shrinath_prabhu.

## [Noise Cluster] AI model version ambiguity and workflow challenges

**Summary:** Users report that model comparisons are unreliable because the specific GPT or Gemini versions in use are rarely disclosed; some note that the o3 variant outperforms others in logic and mathematics. Multiple posts also highlight workflow frictions: effective problem-solving requires sending questions one by one, a 30-minute processing step seen in o3 now appears in other models, and automatic scraping of webpage comment sections can bias the system’s summaries unless comments are deliberately excluded.

## [Noise Cluster] ChatGPT web scrolling bug and voice concerns

**Summary:** Users report that the web version’s Projects view has a scrolling bug that prevents access to older conversations, forcing work-arounds such as injecting custom CSS. Multiple posts also note that Advanced Voice Mode recently changed and now “feels off,” with quality perceived as worse than before. One user contrasts this with Google search, observing that ChatGPT still delivers multi-step answers and suggestions instead of ad-heavy results.

## [Noise Cluster] Frustration with ChatGPT-generated Twitter content

**Summary:** Users report frustration with the growing flood of ChatGPT-generated posts on X/Twitter, saying it leads to circular, low-quality conversations where people “ask ChatGPT about something written by ChatGPT” and receive meaningless or repetitive answers. Multiple posts mention disappointment when previously trusted accounts or advice-givers turn out to be relying on ChatGPT output, which they feel makes the content “dumb” and diminishes authenticity.

## [Noise Cluster] Concerns about o3-pro performance and behavior

**Summary:** Users report that o3 tends to “reinvent the wheel,” requiring explicit prompting to list existing tools or libraries before it will stop generating new, unnecessary code. Multiple posts complain that o3-pro performs noticeably worse than the retired o1-pro, and removing o1-pro from the Pro subscription is disrupting professional workflows. Additionally, attempts to curb sycophancy with custom instructions can backfire: o3 sometimes overcorrects and becomes stubbornly argumentative or plays “devil’s advocate,” frustrating users.
